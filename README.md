# KCL_Dissertation
  In this GitHub post I will try my best to demonstrate the tools and methods that used in my postgraduate dissertation and a Python script sample is attached as well. For the sake of privacy protection, I will hide part of codes or data source.

# Acknowledgement 
  Much thanks to **@dataabc** but also other contributors for their Python package "weiboSpider" which is open and free to use for non-business activities. This Python package can save much time and energy in Weibo data scraping and is easy to handle, please read more information in this project (https://github.com/dataabc/weiboSpider) and make sure that you have notified the author before using his (their) source code in your dissertation.

  So many thanks to **Professor Jonathan Gray** too! Thanks for having me to wirte this post, helping you guys in King's in your disseration. Hope this helps especially if you guys intend to set **digital methods** and **coding** as the mainstay of dissertaionã€‚
